Welcome to my second blog post!

This time, YAML front matter is used to set the title of the post, and the
content is written in Markdown.

In this post, I'll be discussing more advanced topics and sharing additional
insights. Stay tuned for exciting content!

```clojure
(defn hello-world []
  (println "Hello, World!"))
```
