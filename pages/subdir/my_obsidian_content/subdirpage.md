title = "Subpage"

This showcases that you can have subdirectories in the `pages/` directory, and
they will be rendered as nested paths on the website. For example, this page is
located at `pages/subdir/my_obsidian_content/subdirpage.md`, so it will be
accessible at
`http://localhost:8000/subdir/my_obsidian_content/subdirpage.html`.

You do not need any front matter to create pages in subdirectories; just create
the folders and add your markdown files. The blog generator will handle the
rest!
