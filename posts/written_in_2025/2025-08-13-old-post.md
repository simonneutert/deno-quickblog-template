To render a title, the blog will look for the first heading in the markdown
content.

### You don't even need front matter!

The first H1, H2, or H3 will be used as the title of the post. If no headings
are found, it will fall back to using the first non-empty line, truncated to a
maximum length.

Welcome to this old post! It was moved into a subdirectory to demonstrate how
the blog handles nested paths in the `posts/` directory.

You can nest your posts in subdirectories for better organization. In the end,
just the files matter.
